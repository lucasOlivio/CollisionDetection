# Physics collision

## About

Project for "physics" class. Spheres colliding against each other and against a mesh of triangles.

## Requirements

- Visual studio 2022

## How to run

1. Unzip all libs from the .zip file in the "extern/lib/" folder
2. Open the solution in VS
3. Build first the "Engine" project, then run the startup project
4. If using the .exe generated remember that it should be at the same folder as the "assets" and "configs" folder
5. Press P to start playing.
6. Press SPACE to shoot the balls.

## Questions

- The objects collision are detected in the EnginePhysics/Physics class, it will detect the type of collision and give the appropriate response accordingly to the type of the body (Kinatic, dynamic or static)
- The collisions formula are all in the EnginePhysics/Physics class for now. The type of collisions fully implemented are Sphere-Sphere, Sphere-Mesh, Sphere-OBB (The Sphere-OBB collision is not working properly, the collision detection is happening, but the response is wrong and I wasn't able to fix it.)
- The collisions are detected in the "CheckCollisions" function and the responses happen at the "ResolveCollision" function

## How to use

- To alternate between play mode or editor mode press P
- To open and shut the doors press C
- To change any model, light or camera location you can just change the parameters on the "database" files
- To change in the scene you can also use these controls:
  - Close Window: GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE - Close the window when the GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE key is pressed.
  - Save Scene: GLFW_KEY_F1 - Save the scene when the GLFW_KEY_F1 key is pressed.
  - Reload Scene: GLFW_KEY_F5 - Reload the scene when the GLFW_KEY_F5 key is pressed.

  - CTRL key down + action key (Light controls):
    - Page Up (GLFW_KEY_PAGE_UP) and Page Down (GLFW_KEY_PAGE_DOWN) - Change the selected light.
    - A (GLFW_KEY_A) and D (GLFW_KEY_D) - Move the selected light in the X direction.
    - Q (GLFW_KEY_Q) and E (GLFW_KEY_E) - Move the selected light in the Y direction.
    - S (GLFW_KEY_S) and W (GLFW_KEY_W) - Move the selected light in the Z direction.
    - Z (GLFW_KEY_Z) and X (GLFW_KEY_X) - Change the linear attenuation of the selected light.
    - C (GLFW_KEY_C) and V (GLFW_KEY_V) - Change the quadratic attenuation of the selected light.
    - F (GLFW_KEY_F) and H (GLFW_KEY_H) - Change the direction of the selected light in the X-axis.
    - R (GLFW_KEY_R) and Y (GLFW_KEY_Y) - Change the direction of the selected light in the Y-axis.
    - G (GLFW_KEY_G) and T (GLFW_KEY_T) - Change the direction of the selected light in the Z-axis.
    - J (GLFW_KEY_J) and L (GLFW_KEY_L) - Change parameter 0 of the selected light.
    - U (GLFW_KEY_U) and O (GLFW_KEY_O) - Change parameter 1 of the selected light.
    - K (GLFW_KEY_K) and I (GLFW_KEY_I) - Change parameter 2 of the selected light.
    - B (GLFW_KEY_B) - Toggle the selected light.

  - SHIFT key down + action key (Mesh controls): Similar to light controls, but these actions apply to the selected mesh instead of the light.

  - No modifier key down (Camera controls):
    - A (GLFW_KEY_A) and D (GLFW_KEY_D) - Move the camera in the X direction.
    - Q (GLFW_KEY_Q) and E (GLFW_KEY_E) - Move the camera in the Y direction.
    - S (GLFW_KEY_S) and W (GLFW_KEY_W) - Move the camera in the Z direction.
    - Z (GLFW_KEY_Z) and X (GLFW_KEY_X) - Change the camera target in the X direction.
    - C (GLFW_KEY_C) and V (GLFW_KEY_V) - Change the camera target in the Y direction.
